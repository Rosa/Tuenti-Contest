Tuenti Contest Solutions
========================

Here you can find my solutions to the challenges of the Tuenti Contest.

Some are quite ugly and a couple are totally 'ad hoc'. ch16 is the only one with kind of well commented code, mainly due to embarrassment when I shared it on Twitter before the final round in Madrid. 

There is one file for each challenge, except for the second (for which I used one of the best programming languages in the world, Prolog).


Comments, insults...
